# Torchic Wikipedia

## Description

First HTML project inspired by Bulbapedia's Torchic page.
Testing elements learnt during the web development bootcamp on this project to practically apply my knowledge.

_This page is for educational purposes and all information comes from [Bulbapedia's Torchic Page](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Torchic_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>) and [PokemonDB's Torchic Page](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/torchic). I do not own or claim this work and am using it purely for study purposes.\_
